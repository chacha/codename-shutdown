<p>Good Job! You have officially exited the basic training course. Things will now get harder.</p>
<p>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.</p>
<p>If all the numbers from 1 to 100 (one hundred) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>

<p>Do not count spaces or hyphens. "twenty-two" has 9 letters.</p>
