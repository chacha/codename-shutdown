<p>Good Job! You have officially exited the basic training course. Things will now get harder.</p>
<p>A fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers created by adding the sums of the previous two numbers. For instance, adding 0 and 1 would give you the third number, 1. 1 + 1 = 2, and so on.</p>
<p>The next 10 terms would be:</p>
<pre>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89</pre>
<p>In this case the 6th fibonacci number is 5.</p>
<p>Find the 30th.</p>
