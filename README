This is a interactive coding challenge game built to stimulate problem solving and critical thinking skills.

The idea of the game is that students will start with a normal set of programming math questions. However, 
while solving math problems students will begin to see the underlyings of the system they are working on that
will allow them to explore the inner-workings on the system and lead them on a quest more interesting
than solving a bunch of problems.
